        text: Feature enhancement
      content: Inviting a user just became easier. All you need to do when inviting
        a new user is add their email address and associate them to one of the new
        system generated teams available to you which will grant them a set of permissions
        as soon as they sign-up. They can instantly start working with you on the
        platform without needing to give them specific permissions after they accept
        an invite.
