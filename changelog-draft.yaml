      release: '1.57'

      - type: success
        text: New feature
      content: 'We introduced new documentation pages for the CloudBees cloud-native
        platform REST API. They explain how to integrate with platform data using
        standard HTTP methods and JSON-formatted responses, including tasks like creating
        and managing feature flags, target groups, and custom properties. Detailed
        examples and parameter tables guide you through authentication, retrieving
        resource IDs, and handling errors. You can automate workflows, build custom
        integrations, and enhance your {PRODUCT} experience with these APIs. Refer
        to the new documentation to get started.  xref:cloudbees-platform:api-references:index.adoc[API

        text: New feature
      content: 'Revised:  Reuse workflows within other workflows to reduce duplication,
        simplify maintenance, and promote best practices. Simply call a reusable workflow
        to streamline automation. Original version:  We have introduced a mechanism
        to reuse workflows, so that teams can avoid duplicating code, simplify maintainability
        and to encourage best-practices, by simply calling reusable workflows from
        their workflows.

    - title: Ability to check if a change request you are creating conflicts with
        an established ServiceNow blackout window
      release: '1.57'
      badges:
      - type: info
        text: Feature enhancement
      content: 'We introduced the ability to check before a change request is created
        in ServiceNow whether there is a blackout window. This  gives you the power
        to decide if you want to proceed with creating a change request or not. This
        is especially useful in creating ServiceNow automation use cases.

      version: '1.57'
    - title: Added validation to prevent deletion of in-use custom properties
      release: '1.57'
      badges:
      - type: info
        text: Feature enhancement
      content: 'Revised, shorter version:  Delete custom properties with built-in
        checks to ensure safe removal. If a property is in use, deletion is disabled,
        and the system alerts the user. The property must be removed from all flag
        configurations before deletion can proceed. - You can now delete custom properties
        directly, with built-in checks to ensure safe removal. Before a property is
        deleted, the system verifies whether it is in use within any flag configurations.
        If the property is in use, deletion is disabled, and the user is alerted.
        The user must take the necessary actions before proceeding with deletion.
        This enhancement ensures that property deletions are intentional, preventing
        unintended impacts on configurations and streamlining the management of custom
        properties.

        and which version is currently active.
